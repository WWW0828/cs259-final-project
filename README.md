# CS259 Chip Design Automation and Deep Learning Final Project
- UCLA, Fall 2024
- Instructors: Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun
- Contributors: Yu-Hsin Weng, Yi-Chun Lo
## Topic Description
Use multi-modality techniques to improve the prediction and search results of HARP model and evaluate your results on Phase 1 task in the [ML Contest for Chip Design with HLS](https://kaggle.com/competitions/machine-learning-contest-for-high-level-synthesis).  
- Bonus 1: show meaningful improvement over HARP.
- Bonus 2: demonstrate the advamtget of your refined model on DSE using the same DSE engine as in HARP.
