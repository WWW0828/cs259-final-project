# CS259 Chip Design Automation and Deep Learning Final Project
- UCLA, Fall 2024
- Instructors: Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun
- Contributors: Yu-Hsin Weng, Yi-Chun Lo
## Topic Description
This project explores advanced techniques for design space exploration (DSE) in high-level synthesis (HLS), aiming to enhance methods like exhaustive search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms used in GNN-DSE\cite{gnn-dse} and HARP\cite{harp2023}. Our goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to 10 new programs, generated by modifying loop bounds in HLSyn examples or using entirely different ones. These programs will create a solution space of over 100,000 design points. With a search time limited to 4 hours, we aim to show a clear advantage of our method over the existing search techniques in HARP.
